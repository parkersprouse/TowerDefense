# Tower Defense
My attempt at creating a Tower Defense game using the LibGDX library written in Java. This is my second project, and one that I'm proud of the progress I've made with. Like my other projects, it's incomplete and could contain bugs and glitches.

There's one level in the game, and ten waves of enemies on that level. It's very unbalanced, contains one enemy type, and three tower types.
